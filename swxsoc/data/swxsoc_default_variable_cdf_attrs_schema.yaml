  REFERENCE_POSITION:

      Reference_Position is optional metadata to account for time variance with position in 
      the gravity wells and with relative velocity. While we could use a combined 
      TimeSystem attribute that defines mission-specific time scales where needed, such as 
      UTC-at-STEREO-B, it's cleaner to keep them separate as Time_Scale=UTC and 
      Reference_Position=STEREO-B.

      second in ISO8601 relative time (+/- time, most commonly: "+1s") [default: standard 
      list of leap seconds up to time of data]. Leap_Seconds_Included is needed to account 
      for time scales that don't have all 34 (in 2009) leap seconds and for the clocks in 
      various countries that started using leap seconds at different times. The full list is 
      required to handle the equally or more common case where a time scale starts at a 
      pecific UTC but continues on without leap seconds in TAI mode; this is basically what 
      missions that don't add leap seconds are doing.

  VARIABLE_PURPOSE:
    description: >
      are a list of tags/keywords separated by commas that indicate probable uses of the variable and its function.
      Software can use these attributes to find the primary variables in the dataset, find variables with a common function, indicate variables suitable for specific purposes such as summary plots or educational displays, etc.
      Tags could indicate a common geophysical quantity to enable matching several variables of the same kind.
      For instance, all magnetic field variables could be tagged with VARIABLE_PURPOSE="Magnetic_Field" even though they have different coordinate systems or cadences.
      Software could use this tag to identify variables with a common theme for easier distinguishing between groups of variables and selecting between them.
      The values are always in a character string.
      Suggested tags/keywords include:
      - "PRIMARY_VAR": one of the primary variables in the dataset
      - "EDUCATION": one of the variables suitable for displaying in an educational context
      - "SUMMARY": one the variables to display on automatic summary plots
      - "CARTESIAN", "ANGULAR": distinguish variables by coordinate system
      - "Magnetic_Field", "Electric_Field", etc.: common instrument tag to relate similar variables
