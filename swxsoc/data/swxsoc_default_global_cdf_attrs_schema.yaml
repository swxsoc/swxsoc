Project:
  description: >
    This attribute identifies the name of the project and indicates ownership. For ISTP missions 
    and investigations, the value used is "ISTP>International Solar-Terrestrial Physics". For 
    the Cluster mission, the value is "STSP Cluster>Solar Terrestrial Science Programmes, Cluster". 
    Other acceptable values are "IACG>Inter-Agency Consultative Group", "CDAWxx>Coordinated Data 
    Analysis Workshop xx", and "SPDS>Space Physics Data System". Others may be defined in future. 
    This attribute can be multi-valued if the data has been supplied to more than one project.

Source_name:
  description: >
    This attribute identifies the mission or investigation that contains the sensors. 
    For ISTP, this is the mission name for spacecraft missions or the investigation name 
    for ground-based or theory investigations. Both a long name and a short name are provided. 
    This attribute should be single valued. Examples:

TEXT:
  description: >
    This attribute is an SPDF standard global attribute, which is a text description of the
    experiment whose data is included in the CDF. A reference to a journal article(s) or to a
    World Wide Web page describing the experiment is essential and constitutes the
    minimum requirement. A written description of the data set is also desirable. This
    attribute can have as many entries as necessary to contain the desired information.
    Typically, this attribute is about a paragraph in length and is not shown on CDAWeb.
    CDAWeb is the web portal for access to SPDF data, available at https://cdaweb.gsfc.nasa.gov.
