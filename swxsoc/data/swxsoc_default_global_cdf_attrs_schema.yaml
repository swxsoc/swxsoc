    This attribute is an SPDF standard global attribute, which is a text description of the
    experiment whose data is included in the CDF. A reference to a journal article(s) or to a

    attribute can have as many entries as necessary to contain the desired information.
    Typically, this attribute is about a paragraph in length and is not shown on CDAWeb.
    CDAWeb is the web portal for access to SPDF data, available at https://cdaweb.gsfc.nasa.gov.

Validate:
  description: >
    Details to be specified.
    This attribute is written by software for automatic validation of features such as the structure of the CDF file on a simple pass/fail criterion.
    The software will test that all expected attributes are present and, where possible, have reasonable values.
    The syntax is likely to be of the form "test>result>where-done>date".
    It is not the same as data validation.
